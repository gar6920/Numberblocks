# ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES ⚠️
# 1. Server Authority Rule:
#    - Server MUST have final authority over ALL game state
#    - Server MUST control ALL movements and positions
#    - Client can ONLY:
#      * Send input/action requests to server
#      * Render authoritative state from server
#      * Interpolate between server updates

# 2. Core vs Implementation Rule:
#    - If multiple implementations need it -> MUST be in core
#    - If unique to one implementation -> MUST be in implementation folder
#    - NEVER mix implementation-specific code into core
