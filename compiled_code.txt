----------------------------------------------------- 
 
Core Components
1. Server (server.js)
Technology: Built with Node.js and Colyseus.

Responsibilities:
Manages game rooms and player connections/disconnections.

Maintains the authoritative game state, including player positions, Numberblock values, and operator states.

Processes player inputs (e.g., movement, operator usage) and updates the game state.

Broadcasts state updates to all connected clients at a fixed interval.

Key Features:
Handles spawning and management of operators.

Ensures scalability for up to 20 networked players.

2. Client (client/)
The client is responsible for rendering the game, capturing user inputs, and communicating with the server. Key files include:
main.js:
Initializes the Three.js scene, renderer, and cameras for each local player.

Establishes a WebSocket connection to the server via Colyseus.

Manages split-screen rendering by creating dynamic viewports for local multiplayer.

Updates the local state based on server broadcasts.

controls.js:
Captures and processes inputs from keyboards and gamepads using the Gamepad API.

Maps inputs to player actions (e.g., movement, jumping) and sends them to the server.

numberblock.js:
Defines the Numberblock class for rendering player characters in the 3D scene.

Updates visual properties (e.g., size, color) based on server-synced values.

operator.js:
Manages the visualization of operators (e.g., addition, subtraction) in the scene.

Reflects server-controlled states for operator collection and usage.

hud.js:
Renders a heads-up display (HUD) for each player, showing their current Numberblock value and held operator.

Adapts to split-screen layouts for local multiplayer.

3. Networking
Technology: Uses Colyseus for real-time state synchronization between clients and the server.

Implementation:
Clients connect to the server via WebSockets using the Colyseus.js library.

The server ensures consistency across all clients and prevents cheating by maintaining authoritative control over the game state.

State updates are broadcast efficiently to minimize latency.

4. Multiplayer Features
Split-Screen Support:
Supports up to 4 local players on a single device.

Dynamically creates multiple viewports, each with its own camera and renderer instance, based on the number of local players.

Gamepad Support:
Integrates the Gamepad API to detect and map gamepad inputs to player actions.

Allows seamless use of controllers alongside keyboard inputs.

Networked Play:
Enables multiple clients (local and remote) to join a game session over a network.

The server manages synchronization, ensuring all players see the same game state.

Initialization Flow
Server: Starts and listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.

Client: Loads index.html, initializes the Three.js environment, connects to the server, and registers local players (assigning unique IDs).

Game Loop: Clients send inputs to the server, which updates the game state and broadcasts it back to all clients for rendering.

Control Flow
User inputs (via keyboard or gamepad) are captured by controls.js and sent to the server.

The server processes these inputs, updates the game state (e.g., player positions, operator effects), and broadcasts the new state to all clients.

Each client updates its local state and renders the scene based on the server's authoritative data.

Future Enhancements
Advanced Operators: Introduce more complex mechanics like multiplication or division.

Game Modes: Add objectives or competitive/cooperative modes.

Customization: Allow players to customize their Numberblocks and save profiles.

This updated architecture.md file provides a detailed and structured overview of the Numberblocks game's architecture after incorporating multiplayer features. It reflects the separation of client and server responsibilities, the integration of local and networked multiplayer, and the addition of gamepad support, making the game both scalable and maintainable.

Numberblocks FPS Game Design Document
Introduction
This document outlines the design for a multiplayer, browser-based, first-person perspective game inspired by the Numberblocks TV show. Players take on the role of Numberblocks, collect mathematical operators, and interact with other players to change their numerical values, aiming to achieve specific objectives in a fun and engaging way.
Overview
In this game, players navigate a colorful 3D world as Numberblocks, each representing a number. By collecting floating plus (+) and minus (-) operators and bumping into other players, they can add or subtract the other player's number from their own, altering their value. The game offers various modes, such as reaching a target number or eliminating opponents by reducing them to zero.
Core Mechanics
Player Movement
Players move in a first-person perspective with standard FPS controls:
WASD or arrow keys: Move forward, backward, left, and right.

Mouse: Look around.

Spacebar: Jump 

Operator Collection
Plus (+) and minus (-) operators spawn randomly across the game world.

Players collect an operator by running into it and can hold only one at a time.

Operators are visually distinct (e.g., a glowing "+" or "−") and float slightly above the ground.

Bumping Interaction
When a player with an operator bumps into another player, the operator is applied:
Plus Operator (+): The initiating player's number becomes their current number plus the other player's number (e.g., 3 + 2 = 5).

Minus Operator (-): The initiating player's number becomes their current number minus the other player's number (e.g., 3 - 2 = 1).

The other player's number remains unchanged.

The operator is consumed after use, requiring the player to collect a new one.

Number Changes
As a player's number changes, their character model updates:
Larger numbers grow in size (e.g., a Numberblock of 10 is bigger than one of 1).  The player's avatar is blocks that amount to their number.

Optional balancing: Larger numbers move slower but resist displacement, while smaller numbers are faster but more vulnerable.

Game World
Visual Style
The environment is bright, blocky, and inspired by the Numberblocks aesthetic.

Features include platforms, ramps, hiding spots, and open areas for player interaction.

Maps
Multiple themed maps:
Number Forest: Trees and terrain shaped like numbers.

Block City: A city of colorful block buildings.

Mathematical Playground: A playful area with slides and obstacles.

Maps encourage exploration and strategic positioning.

Interactive Elements
Some areas may require a specific number to access (e.g., a gate that opens only for players ≥ 10).

Player Characters
Appearance
Players are Numberblocks, with a block count matching their current number.  Their shape may be straight up, or rows of several blocks, or even arms and legs as the numbers get bigger.  But they are always made of blocks and their number is always visible.

The model dynamically adjusts as the number changes (e.g., growing from 1 block to 10 blocks).

Size and Speed (Optional)
Larger Numbers: Slower movement speed, harder to push.

Smaller Numbers: Faster movement, easier to displace.

This adds a layer of strategy to growing or shrinking.

Operators
Spawning
Operators appear at random intervals and locations on the map.

Spawn rates are balanced to ensure availability without overwhelming players.

Collection
Players collect an operator by touching it.

Collecting a new operator replaces the current one if the player is already holding one.

Usage
Operators activate automatically upon bumping into another player.

After use, the operator is consumed.

Game Objectives
The game supports multiple modes:
1. Target Number Mode
Objective: Reach a specific number (e.g., 100) by adding to your value.

The first player to hit the target wins.

2. Elimination Mode
Objective: Reduce other players to zero or below using the minus operator.

Players at zero or negative are eliminated; the last one standing wins.

3. Score-Based Mode
Objective: Earn points for each operation performed (e.g., +1 point per addition/subtraction).

The player with the most points at the end wins, tracked via a leaderboard.

Multiplayer Features
Real-Time Interaction
Multiple players inhabit the same world, interacting in real time.

Players can see each other's numbers and operators for strategic planning.

Teams (Optional)
Team modes allow collaboration, such as achieving the highest combined team number.

Handling Edge Cases
Zero or Negative Numbers
If a player's number reaches zero or below:
Respawn Option: They are out for 10 seconds, then return as 1.

Elimination Option: They are removed from the round (used in Elimination Mode).

Maximum Number Limit
A cap (e.g., 100) prevents excessive growth.

Optional: Larger numbers face rarer plus operators to slow their progress.

User Interface (UI)
Heads-Up Display (HUD)
Shows:
Player's current number.

Held operator (if any).

Optional: Score or mini-map.

Menus
Main Menu: Choose game mode, map, and settings.

Lobby: Join or create multiplayer matches.

Controls
Movement: WASD or arrow keys.

Look: Mouse.

Jump: Spacebar (if implemented).

Interact: Automatic via bumping.

Audio
Background Music: Upbeat, Numberblocks-inspired tunes.

Sound Effects:
Operator collection (e.g., a cheerful "ding").

Bumping (e.g., a soft "thud").

Number change (e.g., a growing/shrinking sound).

Technical Considerations
Platform
Browser-based, using WebGL for 3D rendering (e.g., Three.js).

Networking
Real-time multiplayer requires server-side syncing of:
Player positions. 

Numbers.

Operator states and spawns.

Optimization
Must run smoothly on various devices/browsers.

Efficient collision detection is key for bumping mechanics.

Future Features
Power-Ups: Shields (block operators) or speed boosts.

Advanced Operators: Multiplication/division for complexity (optional).

Customization: Unlockable colors or accessories for Numberblocks.

Educational Mode: Single-player math puzzles for kids.

Conclusion
This game combines the playful, educational charm of Numberblocks with dynamic FPS gameplay. Its simple mechanics make it accessible to children, while strategic depth and multiplayer fun appeal to all ages. With proper balancing and optimization, it can become an entertaining and educational browser-based experience.

 
 
----------------------------------------------------- 
FILE: memory bank\implementation plan.md 
----------------------------------------------------- 
 
Step 1: Set up the basic project structure
Task: Create a new project and set up the files needed for a Three.js-based game.

Details: 
Create an index.html file with a canvas element.

Add a styles.css file for basic styling (e.g., full-screen canvas).

Create a main.js file for JavaScript code.

Include the Three.js library via a CDN (e.g., <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.132.2/build/three.min.js"></script>).

Test: 
Open the project in a browser.

Check that there are no console errors and a blank canvas appears.

Step 2: Create a basic 3D scene
Task: Set up a simple 3D scene with a ground plane and a camera.

Details: 
In main.js, create a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.

Add a flat plane (e.g., a large box) as the ground.

Position the camera above the ground and render the scene.

Test: 
Open the project in a browser.

See the ground plane rendered from the camera’s perspective.

Step 3: Implement first-person camera controls
Task: Add first-person movement controls to the camera.

Details: 
Use Three.js’s FirstPersonControls or a custom controller.

Enable WASD keys for movement and mouse for looking around.

Test: 
Use WASD keys to move and the mouse to look around.

Confirm the controls are smooth and responsive.

Step 4: Create a basic Numberblock model
Task: Add a simple Numberblock model to the scene.

Details: 
Create a single cube to represent a Numberblock with the number 1.

Position it slightly above the ground in the scene.

Test: 
Open the project and see the cube in the scene.

Ensure it’s correctly positioned relative to the ground.

Step 5: Implement player movement
Task: Attach the Numberblock model to the camera and add basic movement.

Details: 
Link the cube’s position to the camera so it moves with it.

Add jumping (spacebar) and gravity to prevent falling through the ground.

Test: 
Move with WASD keys and see the cube move.

Press spacebar to jump and watch the cube rise and fall back to the ground.

Step 6: Add operator spawning
Task: Create and spawn plus (+) and minus (-) operators in the scene.

Details: 
Make simple 3D models (e.g., spheres) for operators, colored differently (e.g., green for +, red for -).

Write a function to spawn them randomly on the ground every few seconds.

Test: 
See operators appear over time at different spots.

Verify they sit on the ground, not floating or underground.

Step 7: Implement operator collection
Task: Allow the player to collect operators by touching them.

Details: 
Detect when the player’s Numberblock collides with an operator.

Remove the operator from the scene and store it as the player’s held operator (limit to one).

Test: 
Walk into an operator and see it disappear.

Confirm the player holds it (e.g., log it to the console or show it on-screen).

Step 8: Implement bumping interaction
Task: Enable bumping into another Numberblock to apply the operator.

Details: 
Add a second, static Numberblock with a fixed number (e.g., 2).

Detect collision with it; if the player has an operator, apply it (e.g., 1 + 2 = 3).

Remove the operator after use.

Test: 
Bump into the static Numberblock with an operator.

Check that the player’s number updates (e.g., from 1 to 3) and the operator is consumed.

Step 9: Update Numberblock model based on number
Task: Change the Numberblock model when its number changes.

Details: 
Write a function to stack cubes vertically based on the player’s number (e.g., 3 cubes for 3).

Update the model after a number change.

Test: 
After bumping and changing the number, see the model update (e.g., from 1 cube to 3).

Ensure it doesn’t clip through the ground.

Step 10 / 11: MULTIPLAYER AND CONTROLLER SUPPORT

SEE MULTIPLAYER AND CONTROLLER FEATURE.MD

Step 12: Implement game objectives
Task: Add the Target Number Mode.

Details: 
Set a target number (e.g., 10).

Display a win message when a player reaches it.

Test: 
Play and reach the target number.

See a win message appear when achieved.

Step 13: Add more game modes
Task: Implement Elimination Mode and Score-Based Mode.

Details: 
Elimination Mode: Remove players whose number reaches zero or below.

Score-Based Mode: Award points for each operation, shown on a leaderboard.

Test: 
Test Elimination Mode: Reach zero and get removed or respawn.

Test Score-Based Mode: Perform operations and see points increase.

Step 14: Polish and optimize
Task: Enhance visuals, add audio, and improve performance.

Details: 
Add basic textures or colors to models.

Include sound effects (e.g., “ding” for collecting operators).

Optimize rendering for smooth gameplay.

Test: 
Play and ensure no lag or glitches.

Hear sound effects and see improved visuals.

Step 15: Add advanced features (optional)
Task: Introduce power-ups or advanced operators.

Details: 
Add a power-up (e.g., speed boost) that spawns like operators.

Optionally, include multiplication operators (e.g., ×2).

Test: 
Collect a power-up and see its effect (e.g., faster movement).

Use an advanced operator and verify the number change.

Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap to develop the Numberblocks FPS game. Each step is simple enough to be handled with a single prompt in the Windsurf IDE, and the accompanying tests ensure that each feature works before moving forward. By following this plan, you can progressively build a fully functional browser-based multiplayer game that aligns with the game design document’s vision.

 
 
----------------------------------------------------- 
FILE: memory bank\Multiplayer and controller implementation plan.md 
----------------------------------------------------- 
 
To address your query about enhancing the Numberblocks game with multiplayer features, I’ll outline a comprehensive plan based on the current single-player codebase. The goals are to separate client and server logic with a local development server, set up local multiplayer with split screens (still server-connected), add gamepad controls, and expand to network/internet multiplayer. Let’s tackle each step methodically.

# 1. Separate Client/Server Logic and Set Up a Local Development Server

## Current State:
The game is entirely client-side, running in the browser with Three.js handling rendering, and all logic (e.g., movement, collisions, operator interactions) executed locally in files like main.js, controls.js, numberblock.js, and operator.js. There’s no server component yet.

## Goal:
Separate the game into client and server components, with the server managing the authoritative game state and the client focusing on rendering and input handling. Set up a local development server to test this setup, preparing for future scalability.

## Solution: Using Colyseus

I recommend using Colyseus, a Node.js-based multiplayer game server framework that integrates well with JavaScript and Three.js. Here’s why:

- **Real-Time Support**: Colyseus uses WebSockets for low-latency communication, ideal for real-time multiplayer.

- **State Synchronization**: It provides built-in tools for syncing game state across clients, reducing the need to reinvent this logic.

- **Scalability**: Designed for multiplayer games, it supports room management and can scale to network play later.

- **Community and Docs**: It has solid documentation and examples, easing implementation.

## Implementation Steps:

### Server Setup

1. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:
   In your project root, run:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install colyseus express
   ```

2. **Update package.json** with a start script:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node server.js"
   }
   ```

3. **Create server.js**:
   ```javascript
   const { Server } = require("colyseus");
   const { Room } = require("colyseus");
   const express = require("express");
   const app = express();
   const httpServer = require("http").createServer(app);

   const gameServer = new Server({ server: httpServer });

   // Define the game room
   class NumberblocksRoom extends Room {
     onCreate(options) {
       this.setState({
         players: {},
         operators: []
       });
       this.maxClients = 4; // Adjust as needed
     }

     onJoin(client, options) {
       this.state.players[client.sessionId] = {
         x: 0,
         y: 1,
         z: 0,
         value: 1,
         operator: null
       };
       console.log(`${client.sessionId} joined`);
     }

     onMessage(client, message) {
       const player = this.state.players[client.sessionId];
       if (message.type === "move") {
         // Validate movement
         const speedLimit = 5 * 0.016; // Assuming 60 FPS
         const dx = message.x - player.x;
         const dz = message.z - player.z;
         if (Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dz * dz) <= speedLimit) {
           player.x = message.x;
           player.y = message.y;
           player.z = message.z;
         }
       } else if (message.type === "operator") {
         player.operator = message.operator;
       }
     }

     onLeave(client) {
       delete this.state.players[client.sessionId];
       console.log(`${client.sessionId} left`);
     }
   }

   gameServer.define("numberblocks", NumberblocksRoom);
   app.use(express.static(".")); // Serve client files
   httpServer.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));

4. **Directory Structure Update**:
   - Move client files (index.html, css/, js/) under a client/ folder.
   - Place server.js in the root.

### Client Modifications

1. **Install Colyseus Client**:
   In the client/ folder:
   ```bash
   npm install colyseus.js
   ```

2. **Update main.js**:
   Connect to the server and sync state:
   ```javascript
   const { Client } = require("colyseus.js");
   const client = new Client("ws://localhost:3000");
   let room;

   async function init() {
     room = await client.joinOrCreate("numberblocks");
     console.log("Joined room:", room.sessionId);

     room.onStateChange((state) => {
       // Update local player and other players from server state
       Object.entries(state.players).forEach(([id, data]) => {
         if (id === room.sessionId) {
           playerNumberblock.setValue(data.value);
           playerNumberblock.mesh.position.set(data.x, data.y, data.z);
         } else {
           // Update or create other Numberblocks
         }
       });
     });

     // Existing scene setup...
   }

   function updateControls(controls, delta) {
     if (controls.isLocked) {
       const pos = controls.getObject().position;
       room.send({ type: "move", x: pos.x, y: pos.y, z: pos.z });
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   From the root:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the game** at http://localhost:3000/client/index.html.

### Benefits:  
- The server now holds the authoritative state, preventing client-side cheating.
- Local testing is streamlined, and the setup scales to network play later.

## Server Authority: Handling Discrepancies Between Client-Side Predictions and Server-Side Validation

To handle discrepancies between client-side physics predictions and server-side validation, especially when operator collection changes a player's Numberblock value:

- **Client-Side Prediction**: When a player collects an operator, the client immediately updates the Numberblock's value locally for instant feedback, making the game feel responsive.

- **Server Validation**: The client sends the collection event to the server, which checks if the operator was available (e.g., not already collected). If valid, the server updates the game state and broadcasts the new value to all clients.

- **Reconciliation**: If the server rejects the action (e.g., another player collected it first), it sends a correction to the client, which then adjusts the local state to match the server's authoritative version.

This method ensures a balance between responsiveness and consistency, preventing cheating while keeping gameplay smooth.

# 2. Set Up Local Multiplayer with Split Screens (Server-Connected)

## Goal:
Enable multiple players on one machine using split screens, each connecting to the local server as separate clients.

## Implementation:

### Modify Client for Multiple Instances:

1. **Update index.html** to support multiple viewports:
   ```html
   <canvas id="player1-canvas" style="width: 50%; height: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0;"></canvas>
   <canvas id="player2-canvas" style="width: 50%; height: 100%; position: absolute; right: 0;"></canvas>
   ```

2. **Update main.js** for Split Screens:
   Create separate renderers and cameras for each player:
   ```javascript
   let players = [];

   async function init() {
     for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
       const canvas = document.getElementById(`player${i + 1}-canvas`);
       const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas, antialias: true });
       renderer.setSize(canvas.clientWidth, canvas.clientHeight);

       const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight, 0.1, 1000);
       const controls = initControls(camera, canvas);

       const room = await client.joinOrCreate("numberblocks");
       const player = { renderer, camera, controls, room, numberblock: null };
       players.push(player);

       room.onStateChange((state) => {
         const data = state.players[room.sessionId];
         if (!player.numberblock) {
           player.numberblock = new Numberblock(data.value);
           scene.add(player.numberblock.mesh);
         }
         player.numberblock.setValue(data.value);
         player.numberblock.mesh.position.set(data.x, data.y, data.z);
       });
     }
     animate();
   }

   function animate() {
     requestAnimationFrame(animate);
     const delta = clock.getDelta();
     players.forEach((p, i) => {
       updateControls(p.controls, delta);
       p.renderer.render(scene, p.camera);
       p.room.send({ type: "move", x: p.controls.getObject().position.x, y: p.controls.getObject().position.y, z: p.controls.getObject().position.z });
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Input Handling**:
   Assign different keys:
   - Player 1: WASD, Space

   - Player 2: Arrow keys, Enter

4. **Update controls.js**:
   ```javascript
   function onKeyDown(event, playerId) {
     if (playerId === 0) {
       switch (event.code) {
         case 'KeyW': moveForward = true; break;
         case 'KeyA': moveLeft = true; break;
         case 'KeyS': moveBackward = true; break;
         case 'KeyD': moveRight = true; break;
         case 'Space': if (canJump) velocity.y += jumpHeight; canJump = false; break;
       }
     } else if (playerId === 1) {
       switch (event.code) {
         case 'ArrowUp': moveForward = true; break;
         case 'ArrowLeft': moveLeft = true; break;
         case 'ArrowDown': moveBackward = true; break;
         case 'ArrowRight': moveRight = true; break;
         case 'Enter': if (canJump) velocity.y += jumpHeight; canJump = false; break;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Resource Management: Optimizing Performance for Split-Screen Multiplayer

When using split-screen multiplayer, these optimizations will help maintain performance given the doubled rendering workload:

- **Simplify Models**: Reduce the polygon count of Numberblock models and use simpler textures.

- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Render less detailed models for distant objects to lower the rendering cost.

- **Batching**: Combine draw calls for static or repeated objects (e.g., operators) to minimize overhead.

- **Shared Calculations**: Reuse camera updates where possible across viewports to avoid redundant processing.

- **Profiling**: Regularly monitor performance (e.g., with browser tools or Three.js stats) to identify and fix bottlenecks.

These steps ensure the game runs smoothly even with multiple players on a single screen.

## Player Identification: Visual Indicators for Players

Beyond session IDs, these visual indicators will help players identify their own and other players' Numberblocks in the game world:

- **Unique Colors**: Assign each player a distinct color, applied to their Numberblock's base or a visible part.

- **Name Tags**: Display a small name or icon above each Numberblock, visible to all players.

- **Viewport Labels**: In split-screen mode, add a border or label (e.g., "Player 1") to each viewport.

These indicators make it easy to distinguish characters in both networked and split-screen play.

## UI/UX Considerations: Designing the Split-Screen HUD

The HUD for split-screen mode will be designed to display each player's current value without cluttering the interface:

- **Corner Placement**: Put each player's HUD (showing their value and operator) in a corner of their viewport (e.g., top-left for Player 1).

- **Minimal Design**: Use small text or icons to show only essential info, avoiding overlap with gameplay.

- **Transparency**: Apply semi-transparent backgrounds to keep the game world visible.

This layout ensures players can track their status without a cluttered screen.

## Result:
Two players can play locally with split screens, each viewport rendering their perspective, while the server synchronizes their states.

# 3. Set Up Gamepad Controls

## Goal:
Add gamepad support for local players, enhancing accessibility.

## Implementation:

### Use the Gamepad API:

1. **Update controls.js**:
   ```javascript
   let gamepads = [];

   function updateGamepads() {
     gamepads = navigator.getGamepads().filter(gp => gp && gp.connected);
   }

   window.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', (e) => {
     console.log(`Gamepad ${e.gamepad.index} connected`);
     updateGamepads();
   });

   window.addEventListener('gamepaddisconnected', (e) => {
     console.log(`Gamepad ${e.gamepad.index} disconnected`);
     updateGamepads();
   });

   function updateControls(controls, delta, playerId) {
     updateGamepads();
     const gp = gamepads[playerId];
     if (gp) {
       const axes = gp.axes;
       const buttons = gp.buttons;

       // Movement (left stick)
       moveForward = axes[1] < -0.5;
       moveBackward = axes[1] > 0.5;
       moveLeft = axes[0] < -0.5;
       moveRight = axes[0] > 0.5;

       // Look (right stick)
       controls.getObject().rotation.y -= axes[2] * 0.05;
       pitch -= axes[3] * 0.05;
       pitch = Math.max(-Math.PI / 2, Math.min(Math.PI / 2, pitch));
       controls.getObject().children[0].rotation.x = pitch;

       // Jump (A button)
       if (buttons[0].pressed && canJump) {
         velocity.y += jumpHeight;
         canJump = false;
       }
     }
     // Existing keyboard controls...
   }
   ```

### Gamepad Priority: Assigning Controllers to Players

For assigning multiple gamepads to players:

- **Connection Order**: Map gamepads to players based on when they're connected (e.g., first gamepad = Player 1, second = Player 2).

- **Manual Option**: Add a setup screen where players can assign gamepads if needed.

This simple system works out of the box but offers flexibility for customization.

## Result:
Players can use gamepads instead of keyboards, with movement, looking, and jumping mapped to standard controls (e.g., left stick for movement, right stick for looking, A for jumping).

# 4. Expand to Network/Internet Multiplayer

## Goal:
Enable players on different machines to join the game over the internet.

## Implementation:

### Host the Server Publicly:

1. **Deploy server.js** to a cloud platform like Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku create numberblocks-game
   git push heroku main
   ```

2. **Update client connection**:
   ```javascript
   const client = new Client("wss://numberblocks-game.herokuapp.com");
   ```

### Operator Distribution: Synchronizing Operators Across Clients

Operators must be synchronized to ensure all players see the same game state:

- **Server Control**: The server manages operator placement and collection. When a player collects an operator, the client notifies the server.

- **First-Come, First-Served**: If two players attempt to collect the same operator at once, the server processes requests in the order received. The first player gets the operator, and it's removed from the game state.

- **Broadcast**: The server updates all clients, ensuring everyone sees the operator disappear and the player's new value.

This approach prevents conflicts and keeps gameplay fair.

### Collision Mechanics: Handling Numberblock-to-Numberblock Interactions

Collisions between Numberblocks in multiplayer should be consistent and cheat-proof:

- **Server-Side Detection**: The server calculates collisions based on Numberblock positions.

- **Mathematical Effects**: If a collision occurs and one player has an operator (e.g., addition), the server applies the effect (e.g., combining values) and updates the game state.

- **Broadcast Updates**: The server sends the new state (e.g., updated values or positions) to all clients.

This server-driven approach ensures fair interactions and allows for fun mathematical gameplay mechanics.

### Connection Handling: Managing Player Disconnections and Reconnections

Stable connection handling enhances the multiplayer experience:

- **Disconnection**: When a player disconnects, the server removes their Numberblock and notifies all clients to update their views.

- **Reconnection**: If a player reconnects within a short time (e.g., 30 seconds), the server can restore their previous state (position, value). Otherwise, they start anew.

- **State Preservation**: For casual play, a simple action history on the server suffices; for persistence, a database could be added later.

This keeps the game running smoothly despite connection issues.

### Synchronization Enhancements:

Add client-side prediction and server reconciliation in server.js:
```javascript
onMessage(client, message) {
  const player = this.state.players[client.sessionId];
  if (message.type === "move") {
    // Validate movement
    const speedLimit = 5 * 0.016; // Assuming 60 FPS
    const dx = message.x - player.x;
    const dz = message.z - player.z;
    if (Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dz * dz) <= speedLimit) {
      player.x = message.x;
      player.y = message.y;
      player.z = message.z;
    }
  }
}
```

### Handle Latency:
Use Colyseus's built-in features for lag compensation.

## Scalability: Player Limits and Gameplay Impact

For managing player limits and their impact on gameplay:

- **Limit**: Start with 4 players for split-screen and 8–10 for networked rooms, adjustable after testing server and game performance.

- **Impact**: More players may create chaotic, crowded gameplay—potentially exciting or overwhelming. Larger maps or adjusted operator spawns can adapt to higher counts.

This starting point allows for a manageable yet engaging experience, with room to scale.

## Result:
Players can connect over the internet, with the server ensuring consistent state across all clients.

# Testing Framework: Approach to Testing Multiplayer Functionality

Robust testing ensures a reliable multiplayer experience:

- **Automated Tests**: Use tools like Jest to verify core functions (e.g., server connections, message handling, state updates).

- **Manual Tests**: Simulate multiple players with browser tabs or devices, testing operator collection, collisions, and disconnections.

- **Tools**: Leverage Colyseus's debugging features (e.g., colyseus-monitor) to inspect room states.

Combining these methods catches bugs and confirms a consistent player experience.

# Additional Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize rendering for split screens (e.g., reduce draw calls per viewport).

- **HUD**: Duplicate HUD elements per player in their viewports.

- **Player IDs**: Use Colyseus session IDs to identify players uniquely.

# Conclusion

By using Colyseus to separate client/server logic, you establish a scalable foundation. Local multiplayer with split screens builds on this, maintaining server authority. Gamepad controls enhance accessibility, and deploying the server publicly extends the game to network play. This step-by-step approach leverages the existing codebase while meeting all your requirements.

# Development Rules and Notes

## PowerShell Command Issues

### Directory Creation
- When creating multiple directories at once with PowerShell's `mkdir` command, you must use quotes when specifying paths with spaces or multiple directories:
  ```
  # INCORRECT (will fail):
  mkdir css js assets assets\images assets\models assets\sounds
  
  # CORRECT (individual commands):
  mkdir css
  mkdir js
  mkdir assets
  mkdir "assets\images"
  mkdir "assets\models"
  mkdir "assets\sounds"
  ```

- PowerShell's `mkdir` doesn't support multiple directory arguments like in Linux/macOS. Create directories one by one or use a loop.

## Server Management and Development Workflow

### Restarting the Development Server
- When making changes to JavaScript files, use the following process to restart the server for clean testing:
  ```powershell
  # 1. Kill any running Node.js server instances (prevents port conflicts)
  taskkill /f /im node.exe
  
  # 2. Start the http-server with cache disabled
  npx http-server -c-1
  ```
- The `-c-1` flag disables caching, ensuring that file changes are immediately visible
- Always kill previous instances of the server to avoid potential port conflicts
- Using `taskkill /f /im node.exe` is more reliable than Ctrl+C which sometimes leaves orphaned processes

## Three.js Implementation Notes

- Always include the Three.js library before your own JavaScript files in the HTML
- When testing, make sure to run a local HTTP server rather than opening the HTML file directly due to CORS restrictions with resource loading
- Use a thin BoxGeometry instead of PlaneGeometry for the ground to ensure proper lighting on both sides
- Always implement window resize handling for responsive design (update camera aspect ratio and renderer size)
- For better performance, set renderer.setPixelRatio to match the device's pixel ratio

## Browser API Considerations

- The Pointer Lock API (used by PointerLockControls) may not work in some environments, especially in embedded preview browsers or when served through certain proxies
- Always implement a fallback mechanism for critical browser APIs in case they fail
- Use try-catch blocks around browser API calls that might not be supported in all environments
- Check browser console for API-related errors when testing in different environments
- When implementing mouse controls:
  - Proper event listener management is essential (add/remove listeners appropriately)
  - Always provide visual feedback when controls are locked/unlocked
  - Ensure complete disengagement of controls when user presses ESC

## JavaScript Considerations

- When using event handlers, store references to them for proper removal later to prevent memory leaks
- For event-based systems (like controls), implement a proper event dispatcher mechanism
- Use class-based or module patterns for complex components to keep code organized
- When dealing with 3D rotations:
  - Separate axes of rotation (yaw, pitch, roll) to prevent gimbal lock issues
  - Always clamp vertical rotation (pitch) to prevent camera flipping

## Git Workflow

- Always update the progress.md file after completing each implementation step
- Keep commit messages descriptive and related to the implementation plan steps

## Project Structure

- Follow the architecture document precisely to ensure consistency
- New JavaScript files should be placed in the js/ directory and then linked in index.html as needed

Tech Stack
Front-End
HTML5: Provides the structure for the game, including the canvas element for 3D rendering and UI components like the heads-up display (HUD) and menus.

CSS3: Styles the UI elements, such as the HUD, player stats, and overlays, ensuring they look polished and are positioned correctly over the game canvas.

JavaScript (ES6+): Drives the game logic, handling player movement, operator collection, real-time updates, and interactions between Numberblocks.

Three.js: A JavaScript library that simplifies WebGL for 3D rendering, used to create the game world, dynamic Numberblock models (e.g., stacks of cubes), and themed maps like Number Forest or Block City.

Web Audio API: Manages audio, including sound effects for actions like bumping into players or collecting operators, and optional background music for immersion.

Back-End
Node.js: Acts as the server-side runtime, serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and managing game logic for multiplayer sessions, such as validating player actions and maintaining game state authority.

Socket.io: Facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between players, syncing positions, numbers, and operator states for a seamless multiplayer experience.

Development Tools
Git: Version control system to track changes, collaborate with others (if applicable), and manage the project’s codebase effectively.

Local Server: A simple server like http-server or Node.js’s built-in http module for testing the game locally during development, simulating both single-player and multiplayer scenarios.

Jest (Optional): A JavaScript testing framework to verify game logic (e.g., operator interactions, collision detection), which can be added as the project scales.

Hosting
Heroku (or similar platforms like AWS, DigitalOcean): Hosts the Node.js application, serving both the front-end assets and WebSocket connections for multiplayer functionality, offering a straightforward deployment solution.

Why This Stack?
Front-End: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are core web technologies, making them essential for a browser-based game. Three.js provides an accessible way to render 3D graphics, while the Web Audio API ensures robust audio support.

Back-End: Node.js integrates seamlessly with JavaScript and Socket.io, offering a lightweight yet powerful solution for real-time multiplayer features like position syncing and player interactions.

Development Tools: Git is a standard for version control, and a local server simplifies testing. Jest is optional but recommended for ensuring reliability as complexity grows.

Hosting: Heroku supports Node.js and WebSocket applications out of the box, making it an ideal choice for deploying the full game (front-end and back-end) in one place.

This tech stack aligns with your project’s needs: a browser-based, multiplayer 3D FPS game with dynamic Numberblock characters, real-time interactions, and themed environments. It’s lightweight, scalable, and leverages widely-used web technologies. Let me know if you’d like more details on any component!
