# 3D AI Game Platform
## Introduction
The 3D AI Game platform is a modular, web-based 3D game environment built with Three.js and Colyseus, utilizing a client-server architecture for multiplayer functionality. Players control customizable characters and interact with a colorful 3D environment. The platform is designed to support various game implementations.

## Platform Overview
This game platform allows players to navigate a 3D world with customizable characters, interact with other players and objects, and participate in various game modes. The platform's modular design enables developers to implement different themes and gameplay mechanics while maintaining the core 3D multiplayer functionality.

## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Colyseus for multiplayer functionality
- Modular entity system for extensible game objects

### 2. Player System
- Customizable player characters based on game implementation
- Support for various movement modes and camera perspectives
- Collision detection and interaction systems

### 3. Game World
- Visual Style: Configurable environment themes
- Features include platforms, ramps, hiding spots, and open areas for player interaction
- Maps encourage exploration and strategic positioning

### 4. Multiplayer Features
- Client-Server Model: Uses Colyseus for WebSocket communication
- Room-Based Gameplay: Players join game rooms with unique session IDs
- Cross-Platform Support: Play on various devices and browsers

## Default Implementation

### Character Design
- Players are represented as simple cubes with customizable colors
- Models can be extended by other implementations for more complex designs
- Size and appearance can be modified based on game mechanics

### Game Mechanics
- **Exploration**: Navigate the 3D environment
- **Interaction**: Basic interactions with the environment and other players
- **Building**: Create and modify structures in the game world

### Game Modes
1. **Free Play**: Explore the environment and interact with other players
2. **Custom Modes**: Framework supports implementation of various game modes

## Multiplayer Features

### Local Split-Screen Multiplayer
- Supports 2-4 players on a single device
- Screen division options based on player count
- Input management for multiple local players

### Online Multiplayer
- Connect to game servers via unique room codes or matchmaking
- Session reconnection support if temporarily disconnected
- Up to 10 players per online game room

### Player Interaction
- Core interaction mechanics defined by the specific game implementation
- Cooperative and competitive actions
- Strategic positioning and tactical play

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side Structure
- **Main Engine**: Initializes the Three.js scene, renderer, and camera
- **Network Core**: Manages connection to the server
- **Controls**: Handles player movement and camera controls
- **Entity System**: 
  - Base Entity class for all game objects
  - Specialized entity classes (Player, NPC, etc.)
  - EntityFactory for creating various game objects

### Server-Side Structure
- Game state management
- Player connection handling
- Physics and collision processing
- Entity spawning and lifecycle management

### Modular Implementation System
- Base classes for core functionality
- Extension points for custom game logic
- Theme-specific assets and behaviors
- Pluggable game modes and rules

## User Interface (UI)
- Heads-Up Display (HUD): Shows player information and game status
- Menus: Main menu, lobby, settings
- Controls: Configurable keyboard/mouse controls

## Audio
- Background Music: Theme-appropriate music
- Sound Effects: Action-based audio feedback
- Spatial Audio: Directional sound for immersion

## Technical Considerations
- Browser-based, using WebGL for 3D rendering
- Real-time multiplayer with server-side state management
- Optimized for performance across devices

## Conclusion
The 3D AI Game platform provides a flexible foundation for creating multiplayer 3D web games with different themes and mechanics. By separating core functionality from specific implementations, developers can create new games while leveraging the existing multiplayer infrastructure, 3D rendering capabilities, and entity management system.
