# 3D AI Game Platform
## Introduction
The 3D AI Game platform is a modular, web-based 3D game environment built with Three.js and Colyseus, utilizing a client-server architecture for multiplayer functionality. Players control customizable characters and interact with a colorful 3D environment. The platform is designed to support various game implementations, with Numberblocks being the first example.

## Platform Overview
This game platform allows players to navigate a 3D world with customizable characters, interact with other players and objects, and participate in various game modes. The platform's modular design enables developers to implement different themes and gameplay mechanics while maintaining the core 3D multiplayer functionality.

## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Colyseus for multiplayer functionality
- Modular entity system for extensible game objects

### 2. Player System
- Customizable player characters based on game implementation
- Support for various movement modes and camera perspectives
- Collision detection and interaction systems

### 3. Game World
- Visual Style: Configurable environment themes
- Features include platforms, ramps, hiding spots, and open areas for player interaction
- Maps encourage exploration and strategic positioning

### 4. Multiplayer Features
- Client-Server Model: Uses Colyseus for WebSocket communication
- Room-Based Gameplay: Players join game rooms with unique session IDs
- Cross-Platform Support: Play on various devices and browsers

## Implementation: Numberblocks

### Character Design
- Players are represented as Numberblocks, with a block count matching their current number
- The model dynamically adjusts as the number changes (e.g., growing from 1 block to 10 blocks)
- Size can optionally affect movement speed (larger numbers move slower)

### Game Mechanics
- **Operators**: Plus (+) and minus (-) operators spawn throughout the map
- **Collection**: Players collect operators by touching them
- **Interaction**: Operators activate upon bumping into another player
- **Number Changes**: Players' numbers change based on the operator used

### Game Modes
1. **Target Number Mode**: Reach a specific number (e.g., 100) by adding to your value
2. **Elimination Mode**: Reduce other players to zero using the minus operator
3. **Score-Based Mode**: Earn points for each operation performed

## Multiplayer Features

### Local Split-Screen Multiplayer
- Supports 2-4 players on a single device
- Screen division options based on player count
- Input management for multiple local players

### Online Multiplayer
- Connect to game servers via unique room codes or matchmaking
- Session reconnection support if temporarily disconnected
- Up to 10 players per online game room

### Player Interaction
- Core interaction mechanics defined by the specific game implementation
- Cooperative and competitive actions
- Strategic positioning and tactical play

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side Structure
- **Main Engine**: Initializes the Three.js scene, renderer, and camera
- **Network Core**: Manages connection to the server
- **Controls**: Handles player movement and camera controls
- **Entity System**: 
  - Base Entity class for all game objects
  - Specialized entity classes (Player, NPC, etc.)
  - EntityFactory for creating various game objects

### Server-Side Structure
- Game state management
- Player connection handling
- Physics and collision processing
- Entity spawning and lifecycle management

### Modular Implementation System
- Base classes for core functionality
- Extension points for custom game logic
- Theme-specific assets and behaviors
- Pluggable game modes and rules

## User Interface (UI)
- Heads-Up Display (HUD): Shows player information and game status
- Menus: Main menu, lobby, settings
- Controls: Configurable keyboard/mouse controls

## Audio
- Background Music: Theme-appropriate music
- Sound Effects: Action-based audio feedback
- Spatial Audio: Directional sound for immersion

## Technical Considerations
- Browser-based, using WebGL for 3D rendering
- Real-time multiplayer with server-side state management
- Optimized for performance across devices

## Expansion Framework
- **New Implementations**: Blueprint for creating new game themes (e.g., Letterblocks, Shapes)
- **Asset Integration**: System for adding new models, textures, and sounds
- **Rule Customization**: Framework for defining custom game rules
- **UI Theming**: Adaptable UI system for different game implementations

## File Structure
- **/client**: Front-end code
  - **/js**: JavaScript files
    - **/core**: Core engine components
    - **/entities**: Entity definitions
    - **/implementations**: Game-specific implementations
    - **/ui**: User interface components
  - **/css**: Styling
  - **/assets**: Game assets
- **/server**: Server-side code
  - Game room definition
  - State management
  - Physics processing

## Conclusion
The 3D AI Game platform provides a flexible foundation for creating multiplayer 3D web games with different themes and mechanics. By separating core functionality from specific implementations, developers can create new games while leveraging the existing multiplayer infrastructure, 3D rendering capabilities, and entity management system.
