Numberblocks FPS Game Design Document
Introduction
This document outlines the design for a multiplayer, browser-based, first-person perspective game inspired by the Numberblocks TV show. Players take on the role of Numberblocks, collect mathematical operators, and interact with other players to change their numerical values, aiming to achieve specific objectives in a fun and engaging way.
Overview
In this game, players navigate a colorful 3D world as Numberblocks, each representing a number. By collecting floating plus (+) and minus (-) operators and bumping into other players, they can add or subtract the other player's number from their own, altering their value. The game offers various modes, such as reaching a target number or eliminating opponents by reducing them to zero.
Core Mechanics
Player Movement
Players move in a first-person perspective with standard FPS controls:
WASD or arrow keys: Move forward, backward, left, and right.

Mouse: Look around.

Spacebar: Jump 

Operator Collection
Plus (+) and minus (-) operators spawn randomly across the game world.

Players collect an operator by running into it and can hold only one at a time.

Operators are visually distinct (e.g., a glowing "+" or "−") and float slightly above the ground.

Bumping Interaction
When a player with an operator bumps into another player, the operator is applied:
Plus Operator (+): The initiating player's number becomes their current number plus the other player's number (e.g., 3 + 2 = 5).

Minus Operator (-): The initiating player's number becomes their current number minus the other player's number (e.g., 3 - 2 = 1).

The other player's number remains unchanged.

The operator is consumed after use, requiring the player to collect a new one.

Number Changes
As a player's number changes, their character model updates:
Larger numbers grow in size (e.g., a Numberblock of 10 is bigger than one of 1).  The player's avatar is blocks that amount to their number.

Optional balancing: Larger numbers move slower but resist displacement, while smaller numbers are faster but more vulnerable.

Game World
Visual Style
The environment is bright, blocky, and inspired by the Numberblocks aesthetic.

Features include platforms, ramps, hiding spots, and open areas for player interaction.

Maps
Multiple themed maps:
Number Forest: Trees and terrain shaped like numbers.

Block City: A city of colorful block buildings.

Mathematical Playground: A playful area with slides and obstacles.

Maps encourage exploration and strategic positioning.

Interactive Elements
Some areas may require a specific number to access (e.g., a gate that opens only for players ≥ 10).

Player Characters
Appearance
Players are Numberblocks, with a block count matching their current number.  Their shape may be straight up, or rows of several blocks, or even arms and legs as the numbers get bigger.  But they are always made of blocks and their number is always visible.

The model dynamically adjusts as the number changes (e.g., growing from 1 block to 10 blocks).

Size and Speed (Optional)
Larger Numbers: Slower movement speed, harder to push.

Smaller Numbers: Faster movement, easier to displace.

This adds a layer of strategy to growing or shrinking.

Operators
Spawning
Operators appear at random intervals and locations on the map.

Spawn rates are balanced to ensure availability without overwhelming players.

Collection
Players collect an operator by touching it.

Collecting a new operator replaces the current one if the player is already holding one.

Usage
Operators activate automatically upon bumping into another player.

After use, the operator is consumed.

Game Objectives
The game supports multiple modes:
1. Target Number Mode
Objective: Reach a specific number (e.g., 100) by adding to your value.

The first player to hit the target wins.

2. Elimination Mode
Objective: Reduce other players to zero or below using the minus operator.

Players at zero or negative are eliminated; the last one standing wins.

3. Score-Based Mode
Objective: Earn points for each operation performed (e.g., +1 point per addition/subtraction).

The player with the most points at the end wins, tracked via a leaderboard.

Multiplayer Features
Real-Time Interaction
Multiple players inhabit the same world, interacting in real time.

Players can see each other's numbers and operators for strategic planning.

Teams (Optional)
Team modes allow collaboration, such as achieving the highest combined team number.

Handling Edge Cases
Zero or Negative Numbers
If a player's number reaches zero or below:
Respawn Option: They are out for 10 seconds, then return as 1.

Elimination Option: They are removed from the round (used in Elimination Mode).

Maximum Number Limit
A cap (e.g., 100) prevents excessive growth.

Optional: Larger numbers face rarer plus operators to slow their progress.

User Interface (UI)
Heads-Up Display (HUD)
Shows:
Player's current number.

Held operator (if any).

Optional: Score or mini-map.

Menus
Main Menu: Choose game mode, map, and settings.

Lobby: Join or create multiplayer matches.

Controls
Movement: WASD or arrow keys.

Look: Mouse.

Jump: Spacebar (if implemented).

Interact: Automatic via bumping.

Audio
Background Music: Upbeat, Numberblocks-inspired tunes.

Sound Effects:
Operator collection (e.g., a cheerful "ding").

Bumping (e.g., a soft "thud").

Number change (e.g., a growing/shrinking sound).

Technical Considerations
Platform
Browser-based, using WebGL for 3D rendering (e.g., Three.js).

Networking
Real-time multiplayer requires server-side syncing of:
Player positions. 

Numbers.

Operator states and spawns.

Optimization
Must run smoothly on various devices/browsers.

Efficient collision detection is key for bumping mechanics.

Future Features
Power-Ups: Shields (block operators) or speed boosts.

Advanced Operators: Multiplication/division for complexity (optional).

Customization: Unlockable colors or accessories for Numberblocks.

Educational Mode: Single-player math puzzles for kids.

Conclusion
This game combines the playful, educational charm of Numberblocks with dynamic FPS gameplay. Its simple mechanics make it accessible to children, while strategic depth and multiplayer fun appeal to all ages. With proper balancing and optimization, it can become an entertaining and educational browser-based experience.
