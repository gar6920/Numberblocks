  - Improved jumping mechanics with physically accurate jump formula
  - Implemented basic ground collision detection to prevent falling through the ground
  - Created true first-person view where camera positioned from Numberblock's perspective

  - Note: Full collision system with other objects not implemented yet
- Completed Step 6 of implementation plan: Added operator spawning
  - Created Operator and OperatorManager classes
  - Implemented operator spawning system
  - Added proper positioning and rotation
  - Integrated with player controls
  - Fixed movement controls after operator integration
  - Ensured proper initialization order
- Completed Step 7 of implementation plan: Implemented operator collection
  - Added collision detection between player's Numberblock and operators
  - Created visual attachment system to make operators attach to Numberblock's hand
  - Modified Numberblock.createArm method to name hand objects for reference
  - Enhanced OperatorManager.setHeldOperator to attach operators to the Numberblock
  - Created smaller version (40% scale) of operator for holding
  - Added robust error handling in collision detection to prevent game freezes
  - Properly integrated collision.js with the rest of the codebase
  - Implemented fallback collision functions for improved stability
- Completed Step 8 of implementation plan: Implemented bumping interaction
  - Added a second static Numberblock to the scene with value 2
  - Implemented collision detection between player and static Numberblock
  - Created logic to apply held operators (plus/minus) when collision occurs
  - Added mathematical operations based on operator type:
    - Plus operator: player.value += staticNumberblock.value
    - Minus operator: player.value -= staticNumberblock.value (with minimum value check)
  - Added visual feedback with immediate Numberblock reconstruction
  - Implemented operator consumption after successful application
  - Added player pushback to prevent continuous collisions
  - Enhanced UI feedback with console logs and visual updates
  - Added error handling for collision detection to prevent game freezes

### Step 9: Update Numberblock Model & Add HUD (Completed March 15, 2025)
- **Updated Numberblock Model**
  - Verified that the Numberblock model correctly updates its visual representation after mathematical operations
  - Enhanced the camera positioning to dynamically adjust based on Numberblock size
  - Fixed visual artifacts and rendering issues with number tags
  - Implemented double-sided transparent materials for better visibility
