# Numberblocks Game - Progress Log

## March 15, 2025
- Completed Step 1 of implementation plan: Set up basic project structure
  - Created index.html with canvas element
  - Added styles.css for basic styling (full-screen canvas)
  - Created main.js for JavaScript code
  - Included Three.js library via CDN
  - Created directory structure following the architecture document
  - Verified that the project loads in browser with no console errors
- Created comprehensive README.md file
- Set up Git repository and GitHub remote
- Added .gitignore file for the project
- Completed Step 2 of implementation plan: Created a basic 3D scene
  - Implemented Three.js scene, camera, and renderer in main.js
  - Added a flat green plane as the ground
  - Positioned the camera above the ground
  - Added proper lighting (ambient and directional)
  - Implemented window resize handling
  - Set up the animation loop
- Completed Step 3 of implementation plan: Implemented first-person camera controls
  - Created controls.js for camera movement functionality
  - Implemented Three.js PointerLockControls for first-person view
  - Added WASD and arrow key movement
  - Implemented jumping with spacebar
  - Added controls info overlay for user guidance
  - Added appropriate styles for the overlay UI
  - Implemented robust fallback mechanism for environments where Pointer Lock API is unavailable
  - Added error handling with try-catch blocks for browser API compatibility
  - Created mockControls object that mimics the PointerLockControls interface for seamless operation
  - Enhanced FPS camera controls:
    - Added parent-child object hierarchy for proper camera rotation
    - Separated yaw (horizontal) and pitch (vertical) rotations for natural camera movement
    - Implemented pitch clamping to prevent camera flipping
    - Added mouse locking within the game window using CSS and event handling
    - Ensured proper cursor disengagement when ESC key is pressed
    - Implemented proper event listener cleanup for complete mouse control disengagement
  - Updated RULES.md with browser API considerations based on implementation experience
- Completed Step 4 of implementation plan: Created a basic Numberblock model
  - Implemented Numberblock class in numberblock.js with all required features:
    - Created a stack of blocks representing the Numberblock's value
    - Added face with eyes and mouth to the top block
    - Added arms on the sides (positioned based on number of blocks)
    - Added feet to the bottom block
    - Added a number tag on top showing the Numberblock's value
  - Used appropriate colors matching the Numberblocks TV show aesthetic
  - Integrated the Numberblock model with the main game:
    - Added the Numberblock to follow the player's movement
    - Positioned it in front of the camera for a first-person view
    - Implemented smooth interpolation for natural movement
    - Added HTML/CSS-based number display that follows the 3D model
  - Added helper functions for creating and updating Numberblocks
  - Added proper resource cleanup methods to prevent memory leaks
- Completed Step 5 of implementation plan: Implemented player movement (partial collision)
  - Added getHeight method to Numberblock class for accurate height calculation
  - Improved jumping mechanics with physically accurate jump formula
  - Implemented basic ground collision detection to prevent falling through the ground
  - Created true first-person view where camera positioned from Numberblock's perspective
  - Ensured perfect synchronization between camera and Numberblock during all movements
  - Implemented two-way position binding to maintain consistent camera-Numberblock relationship
  - Note: Full collision system with other objects not implemented yet
- Completed Step 6 of implementation plan: Added operator spawning
  - Created Operator and OperatorManager classes
  - Implemented operator spawning system
  - Added proper positioning and rotation
  - Integrated with player controls
  - Fixed movement controls after operator integration
  - Ensured proper initialization order
- Completed Step 7 of implementation plan: Implemented operator collection
  - Added collision detection between player's Numberblock and operators
  - Created visual attachment system to make operators attach to Numberblock's hand
  - Modified Numberblock.createArm method to name hand objects for reference
  - Enhanced OperatorManager.setHeldOperator to attach operators to the Numberblock
  - Created smaller version (40% scale) of operator for holding
  - Added robust error handling in collision detection to prevent game freezes
  - Properly integrated collision.js with the rest of the codebase
  - Implemented fallback collision functions for improved stability
- Completed Step 8 of implementation plan: Implemented bumping interaction
  - Added a second static Numberblock to the scene with value 2
  - Implemented collision detection between player and static Numberblock
  - Created logic to apply held operators (plus/minus) when collision occurs
  - Added mathematical operations based on operator type:
    - Plus operator: player.value += staticNumberblock.value
    - Minus operator: player.value -= staticNumberblock.value (with minimum value check)
  - Added visual feedback with immediate Numberblock reconstruction
  - Implemented operator consumption after successful application
  - Added player pushback to prevent continuous collisions
  - Enhanced UI feedback with console logs and visual updates
  - Added error handling for collision detection to prevent game freezes
