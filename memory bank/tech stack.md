Tech Stack
Front-End
HTML5: Provides the structure for the game, including the canvas element for 3D rendering and UI components like the heads-up display (HUD) and menus.

CSS3: Styles the UI elements, such as the HUD, player stats, and overlays, ensuring they look polished and are positioned correctly over the game canvas.

JavaScript (ES6+): Drives the game logic, handling player movement, operator collection, real-time updates, and interactions between Numberblocks.

Three.js: A JavaScript library that simplifies WebGL for 3D rendering, used to create the game world, dynamic Numberblock models (e.g., stacks of cubes), and themed maps like Number Forest or Block City.

Web Audio API: Manages audio, including sound effects for actions like bumping into players or collecting operators, and optional background music for immersion.

Back-End
Node.js: Acts as the server-side runtime, serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and managing game logic for multiplayer sessions, such as validating player actions and maintaining game state authority.

Socket.io: Facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between players, syncing positions, numbers, and operator states for a seamless multiplayer experience.

Development Tools
Git: Version control system to track changes, collaborate with others (if applicable), and manage the project’s codebase effectively.

Local Server: A simple server like http-server or Node.js’s built-in http module for testing the game locally during development, simulating both single-player and multiplayer scenarios.

Jest (Optional): A JavaScript testing framework to verify game logic (e.g., operator interactions, collision detection), which can be added as the project scales.

Hosting
Heroku (or similar platforms like AWS, DigitalOcean): Hosts the Node.js application, serving both the front-end assets and WebSocket connections for multiplayer functionality, offering a straightforward deployment solution.

Why This Stack?
Front-End: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are core web technologies, making them essential for a browser-based game. Three.js provides an accessible way to render 3D graphics, while the Web Audio API ensures robust audio support.

Back-End: Node.js integrates seamlessly with JavaScript and Socket.io, offering a lightweight yet powerful solution for real-time multiplayer features like position syncing and player interactions.

Development Tools: Git is a standard for version control, and a local server simplifies testing. Jest is optional but recommended for ensuring reliability as complexity grows.

Hosting: Heroku supports Node.js and WebSocket applications out of the box, making it an ideal choice for deploying the full game (front-end and back-end) in one place.

This tech stack aligns with your project’s needs: a browser-based, multiplayer 3D FPS game with dynamic Numberblock characters, real-time interactions, and themed environments. It’s lightweight, scalable, and leverages widely-used web technologies. Let me know if you’d like more details on any component!
