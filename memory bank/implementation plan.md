Step 1: Set up the basic project structure
Task: Create a new project and set up the files needed for a Three.js-based game.

Details: 
Create an index.html file with a canvas element.

Add a styles.css file for basic styling (e.g., full-screen canvas).

Create a main.js file for JavaScript code.

Include the Three.js library via a CDN (e.g., <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.132.2/build/three.min.js"></script>).

Test: 
Open the project in a browser.

Check that there are no console errors and a blank canvas appears.

Step 2: Create a basic 3D scene
Task: Set up a simple 3D scene with a ground plane and a camera.

Details: 
In main.js, create a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.

Add a flat plane (e.g., a large box) as the ground.

Position the camera above the ground and render the scene.

Test: 
Open the project in a browser.

See the ground plane rendered from the camera’s perspective.

Step 3: Implement first-person camera controls
Task: Add first-person movement controls to the camera.

Details: 
Use Three.js’s FirstPersonControls or a custom controller.

Enable WASD keys for movement and mouse for looking around.

Test: 
Use WASD keys to move and the mouse to look around.

Confirm the controls are smooth and responsive.

Step 4: Create a basic Numberblock model
Task: Add a simple Numberblock model to the scene.

Details: 
Create a single cube to represent a Numberblock with the number 1.

Position it slightly above the ground in the scene.

Test: 
Open the project and see the cube in the scene.

Ensure it’s correctly positioned relative to the ground.

Step 5: Implement player movement
Task: Attach the Numberblock model to the camera and add basic movement.

Details: 
Link the cube’s position to the camera so it moves with it.

Add jumping (spacebar) and gravity to prevent falling through the ground.

Test: 
Move with WASD keys and see the cube move.

Press spacebar to jump and watch the cube rise and fall back to the ground.

Step 6: Add operator spawning
Task: Create and spawn plus (+) and minus (-) operators in the scene.

Details: 
Make simple 3D models (e.g., spheres) for operators, colored differently (e.g., green for +, red for -).

Write a function to spawn them randomly on the ground every few seconds.

Test: 
See operators appear over time at different spots.

Verify they sit on the ground, not floating or underground.

Step 7: Implement operator collection
Task: Allow the player to collect operators by touching them.

Details: 
Detect when the player’s Numberblock collides with an operator.

Remove the operator from the scene and store it as the player’s held operator (limit to one).

Test: 
Walk into an operator and see it disappear.

Confirm the player holds it (e.g., log it to the console or show it on-screen).

Step 8: Implement bumping interaction
Task: Enable bumping into another Numberblock to apply the operator.

Details: 
Add a second, static Numberblock with a fixed number (e.g., 2).

Detect collision with it; if the player has an operator, apply it (e.g., 1 + 2 = 3).

Remove the operator after use.

Test: 
Bump into the static Numberblock with an operator.

Check that the player’s number updates (e.g., from 1 to 3) and the operator is consumed.

Step 9: Update Numberblock model based on number
Task: Change the Numberblock model when its number changes.

Details: 
Write a function to stack cubes vertically based on the player’s number (e.g., 3 cubes for 3).

Update the model after a number change.

Test: 
After bumping and changing the number, see the model update (e.g., from 1 cube to 3).

Ensure it doesn’t clip through the ground.

Step 10 / 11: MULTIPLAYER AND CONTROLLER SUPPORT

SEE MULTIPLAYER AND CONTROLLER FEATURE.MD

Step 12: Implement game objectives
Task: Add the Target Number Mode.

Details: 
Set a target number (e.g., 10).

Display a win message when a player reaches it.

Test: 
Play and reach the target number.

See a win message appear when achieved.

Step 13: Add more game modes
Task: Implement Elimination Mode and Score-Based Mode.

Details: 
Elimination Mode: Remove players whose number reaches zero or below.

Score-Based Mode: Award points for each operation, shown on a leaderboard.

Test: 
Test Elimination Mode: Reach zero and get removed or respawn.

Test Score-Based Mode: Perform operations and see points increase.

Step 14: Polish and optimize
Task: Enhance visuals, add audio, and improve performance.

Details: 
Add basic textures or colors to models.

Include sound effects (e.g., “ding” for collecting operators).

Optimize rendering for smooth gameplay.

Test: 
Play and ensure no lag or glitches.

Hear sound effects and see improved visuals.

Step 15: Add advanced features (optional)
Task: Introduce power-ups or advanced operators.

Details: 
Add a power-up (e.g., speed boost) that spawns like operators.

Optionally, include multiplication operators (e.g., ×2).

Test: 
Collect a power-up and see its effect (e.g., faster movement).

Use an advanced operator and verify the number change.

Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap to develop the Numberblocks FPS game. Each step is simple enough to be handled with a single prompt in the Windsurf IDE, and the accompanying tests ensure that each feature works before moving forward. By following this plan, you can progressively build a fully functional browser-based multiplayer game that aligns with the game design document’s vision.
