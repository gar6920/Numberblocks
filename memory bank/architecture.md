    Explanation of the Structure
Root: The top-level directory containing essential project files:
index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your application or game.

package.json: (Optional) A file for managing project dependencies if you're using Node.js or a package manager like npm.

README.md: A Markdown file for project documentation, instructions, and notes.

assets/: A folder for all static resources:
images/: Stores image files like textures, icons, or sprites.

models/: Holds 3D model files (if applicable, e.g., for a 3D game).

sounds/: Contains audio files such as sound effects or background music.

css/: A folder for styling:
styles.css: The primary CSS file for styling your UI, HUD, or other visual elements.

js/: A folder for all JavaScript files, each serving a specific purpose:
main.js: The core script that initializes the project (e.g., sets up the scene or game loop).

controls.js: Handles user input and controls (e.g., keyboard or mouse events). Features:
  - Robust fallback mechanisms for browser API compatibility
  - First-person camera controls with parent-child hierarchy for proper rotation
  - Separated yaw and pitch rotations for natural camera movement
  - Mouse locking within the game window with proper cursor disengagement
  - Event handler management for clean switching between locked/unlocked states
  - Support for WASD/Arrow keys movement and spacebar jumping

player.js: Manages player-related logic (e.g., movement, health).

operators.js: Contains logic for operators or game entities (e.g., enemies, NPCs).

network.js: Implements networking features (e.g., multiplayer via WebSockets).

hud.js: Updates the heads-up display (e.g., score, health bar).

gameModes.js: Defines different game modes or rules.

lib/: A folder for external libraries:
three.min.js: The minified Three.js library for 3D rendering (you can add other libraries here as needed).

memory bank/: A folder for documentation and development notes:
implementation plan: Detailed steps for implementing the game features.
progress.md: Tracks completed steps and progress notes.
RULES.md: Contains development guidelines and best practices.
architecture.md: This file - describing the project structure.
