Core Components
1. Server (server.js)
Technology: Built with Node.js and Colyseus.

Responsibilities:
Manages game rooms and player connections/disconnections.

Maintains the authoritative game state, including player positions, Numberblock values, and operator states.

Processes player inputs (e.g., movement, operator usage) and updates the game state.

Broadcasts state updates to all connected clients at a fixed interval.

Key Features:
Handles spawning and management of operators.

Ensures scalability for up to 20 networked players.

2. Client (client/)
The client is responsible for rendering the game, capturing user inputs, and communicating with the server. Key files include:
main.js:
Initializes the Three.js scene, renderer, and cameras for each local player.

Establishes a WebSocket connection to the server via Colyseus.

Manages split-screen rendering by creating dynamic viewports for local multiplayer.

Updates the local state based on server broadcasts.

controls.js:
Captures and processes inputs from keyboards and gamepads using the Gamepad API.

Maps inputs to player actions (e.g., movement, jumping) and sends them to the server.

numberblock.js:
Defines the Numberblock class for rendering player characters in the 3D scene.

Updates visual properties (e.g., size, color) based on server-synced values.

operator.js:
Manages the visualization of operators (e.g., addition, subtraction) in the scene.

Reflects server-controlled states for operator collection and usage.

hud.js:
Renders a heads-up display (HUD) for each player, showing their current Numberblock value and held operator.

Adapts to split-screen layouts for local multiplayer.

3. Networking
Technology: Uses Colyseus for real-time state synchronization between clients and the server.

Implementation:
Clients connect to the server via WebSockets using the Colyseus.js library.

The server ensures consistency across all clients and prevents cheating by maintaining authoritative control over the game state.

State updates are broadcast efficiently to minimize latency.

4. Multiplayer Features
Split-Screen Support:
Supports up to 4 local players on a single device.

Dynamically creates multiple viewports, each with its own camera and renderer instance, based on the number of local players.

Gamepad Support:
Integrates the Gamepad API to detect and map gamepad inputs to player actions.

Allows seamless use of controllers alongside keyboard inputs.

Networked Play:
Enables multiple clients (local and remote) to join a game session over a network.

The server manages synchronization, ensuring all players see the same game state.

Initialization Flow
Server: Starts and listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.

Client: Loads index.html, initializes the Three.js environment, connects to the server, and registers local players (assigning unique IDs).

Game Loop: Clients send inputs to the server, which updates the game state and broadcasts it back to all clients for rendering.

Control Flow
User inputs (via keyboard or gamepad) are captured by controls.js and sent to the server.

The server processes these inputs, updates the game state (e.g., player positions, operator effects), and broadcasts the new state to all clients.

Each client updates its local state and renders the scene based on the server's authoritative data.

Future Enhancements
Advanced Operators: Introduce more complex mechanics like multiplication or division.

Game Modes: Add objectives or competitive/cooperative modes.

Customization: Allow players to customize their Numberblocks and save profiles.

This updated architecture.md file provides a detailed and structured overview of the Numberblocks game's architecture after incorporating multiplayer features. It reflects the separation of client and server responsibilities, the integration of local and networked multiplayer, and the addition of gamepad support, making the game both scalable and maintainable.
